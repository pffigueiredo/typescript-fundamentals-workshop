// We have defined a bunch of variables whose types are inferred by typescript.
// Can you guess which is the type of each of these variables?

// Fill in the [ ]s with the correct type for each variable.

let inferLast = 'Smith'; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
let inferSurname = inferLast; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]

let inferA = '1'; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
let inferB = (2).toString(); // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]

let inferC = true; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
inferC = false; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]

let inferD = inferA.length; // TYPE: [YOUR ANSWER HERE]
