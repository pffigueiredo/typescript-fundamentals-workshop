// We have defined 5 different variables and most of them seem to have some sort
// of type error.

// Fix the following type errors:
let basicsA: number = '2';

let basicsB: string = 2 + 4;

let basicsC: boolean = 1 + 1;

// Fix by changing the "basicsS" value
let basicsN: number = 1 + 1;
let basicsS: string = n;
