# TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript**, which means that it has all of JavaScript's syntax, plus some new syntax as well.

- Any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
- Works as a static type checker
- Needs to be compiled to JavaScript
- Never changes the behaviour of your program

## Advantages and Disadvantages?

PROS
- Type Safety
- Type Completion (intellisense)
- Acts a thin testing layer

CONS
- Adds a new step (build process)
- Has a bit of a learning curve
- Some code might seem overwhelming
